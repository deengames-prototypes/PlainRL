Trollus, 1, Retrieve Trollus' head from 3F, A giant troll killed many townspeople. He attacks sometimes, kills off one or two of us, and retreats. I've had to bury carcasses of our own people, chewed up and mangled. Please, put a stop to this., Quest Maker
Slime-X, 6, Beware of the Slime-X on 6F, Before you go much further, be warned--some sort of slime creature is lurking on the dungeon, some foul offspring of Aarij's magic. Our blacksmith made mention of it, that he saw it once or twice while looking for his hammer; but recently, he went, and never returned. Be on your guard, for the slime is relentless., Quest Maker
Decalotupus, 13, Slay the Decalotupus on 13F, Aarij knows about you. He summoned some sort of multi-tentacled creature to stop you. He appeared here, in town, briefly--how wretched and evil he looks now!--to deliver this message. Beware, adventurer! The creature is a magical creature, strong, and it multiplies its tentacles; unless you slay the creature itself, the tentacles will respawn and revive. Defeat it, and return here., Quest Maker
Execute Aarij, 23, Duel with Aarij on 23F, Aarij is waiting for you! He appeared again while you were gone, and threatened to disembowel me! I told him that you are not here ... he called you a coward, and challenged you to a duel. He's waiting in the masjid, on the 23rd floor. But be vary, adventurer! He is different now, and he may be waiting to ambush you. If you can defeat him, maybe this will end the ordeal once and for all., Quest Maker
Purify the Masjid, 30, Stop monster creation on 30F, Aarij's journal is a terrifying personal account of his discovery of the Jinn, and his communications with them--how he learned to use magic. I cannot name some of the twisted, evil things he has done, that blackened his soul; I only thank God that he won't be doing any of them anymore. Near the end of his journal, he mentioned a Great Summoning, where he called a creature, a powerful creature, from the unseen world, into our masjid; now it's lurking on the last floor, the 30th floor, and somehow causing these monsters. Please, go and put an end to this for good, so that we may be at peace once more. Go with full trust in God, for He is the only one who can help you., Quest Maker
